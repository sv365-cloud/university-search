        "description": "Literary historians generally agree that in the 1970s, in the U.S., there was a significant increase in the publication of diverse forms of African American literature. The 1970s is also often described by scholars as a decade in which there was a renaissance of African American women’s writing as well as the publication of several experimental African American literary works. In this seminar, we will study this lively period in African American literary history primarily through novels, some of them recently republished or adapted into other forms. What idea of African American literature do we get when we read novels from this era? What questions were asked in 1970s African American novels that we continue to ask now? Novels we will likely read include detective fiction, diaristic fiction, satirical fiction, a love story, and historical fiction.",

In this seminar, we will discuss African love stories as complex narratives about romantic relationships, as political fiction, and as spaces where African artists reflect on romantic love, romantic desire, and the idea of romance. In what ways do African love stories published in the twentieth century still speak to us today? How do twenty-first century African artists use love stories to confront contemporary societal concerns?",

Protestors and individuals have defaced, toppled, and petitioned for the removal of Confederate monuments and statues to the white male power elite. This symbolic retributive violence and sometimes ritual care signals a challenge to the long-lived monument. This reading course explores public monuments and the ways in which artists and communities have negotiated history and the politics of memory and remembrance in the United States. We will evaluate the meaning and purpose of monuments that define American public spaces, investigating the problematic narratives and historic controversies surrounding such objects. The removal of monuments asks us to question whose histories have been forgotten, ignored, or suppressed, and what monumental justice might look like.",

In our class, students will study BAM manifestos, poetry, and plays designed to transform audiences.

We will take a broad approach to Black DH, thinking generally about the transformative interplay between Blackness and digital technology, the extent to which digital projects can “recover” Black histories within the archive, and methodological approaches to the study of tech and digital life within Black Studies.

Key topics include sousveillance, dataveillance/data bodies, racialized surveillance, algorithmic bias, surveillance art, and surveillance capitalism.",

Taking our cue from Driftpile Cree poet Billy-Ray Belcourt, we will question the ways in which the “grammar of Indigenous Studies misapprehends the tumult of everyday life” through the field’s emphasis on sovereignty and political recognition. We will trace a colonial history that has made categories such as “the human” and “the subject” unavailable to Native people, and consider the affective conditions created for individuals living within a state made possible only through their elimination. What lives do Native people forge despite the confines that settler colonialism carves for them? How might we better understand these lives through Native literature?",

With a particular focus on social movements, we will examine the circumstances under which people politically mobilize understandings of gender and sexuality, and how these mobilizations relate to issues like marginalization, migration, colonialism, and capitalism.

        "description": "Aging is a fundamental biological process. It is the major risk factor for age-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, osteoporosis, arthritis and Alzheimer's, just to name a few. As life expectancy has increased in the 20th century, these diseases have become the leading causes of death. Recent research has identified universal mechanisms that regulate organismal aging and impact all organ systems. Several gene networks that can regulate the rate of aging and multiple age-related diseases have already been discovered. These mechanisms are conserved throughout evolution and many key insights have been garnered from simple model organisms. Manipulation of these networks has been achieved by diet, genetic engineering, and most recently, with drugs. The goal of modern medicine is to increase healthy survival, as opposed to simply longevity. It is now generally acknowledged that increasing health span – the fraction of our life spans free of frailty and debilitating chronic disease – has become a realistic goal. This course will examine the new concept of \"geroscience\" – the molecular, cellular, and genetic foundations of the biology of aging, and how this knowledge can be applied to therapies for age-associated diseases. Course material will be based on the primary research literature.

Departing from this core, we shall follow the several lines of our enquiry along their path from the Old to the New World (and back to the Old) —to eventually end up exploring the possibility that literature itself (as much as other arts) might serve as a viable means to find some comfort for the exilic distress.",

We will approach these questions by examining the role of conferences, print periodicals, and supranational organizations like the Afro-Asian Writers Association in shaping new understandings of the politicized function of literature.

Through a sampling of poetry, narrative, and film, we will explore the uneven terrain of the Anthropocene, in which the feedback loops of race, class, gender, and other forms of social difference, along with geography itself, continue to separate humans, even as evidence mounts for the inseparability of humans from the rest of the planet, including its nonhuman inhabitants.

Given an adequate amount of data, these models can extract meaningful representations to perform accurate predictions. The collection of vast quantities of biological data naturally leads to the question -- can deep learning help us understand genomics? In this seminar-style class, we will cover the recent research literature trying to answer this question. We will learn how state-of-the-art models like CNNs, RNNs, GCNs, GANs, etc. have been applied to solve significant problems in genomics and what unique challenges are presented by the data in this field.",

Why did Chinese politicians see the reform of family and gender relations as central to their larger political goals? What were the “new” gender relations supposed to be?

Focusing on the work of Asian women, we explore feminist film theory, beginning with Laura Mulvey’s 1970s analysis and extending through contributions that have enriched and challenged it. The first unit examines canonical feminist film theory texts on the gaze, representation, and feminist reading practices, paired with global films to assess their ongoing relevance.

By the end of the course, students should have a firm grasp of the research designs and methods that are commonly used to address selection/endogeneity problems in empirical economics and be comfortable working with large-scale data sets. The primary assignment in the course is the production of an original research paper, with an in-class presentation. Other assignments will include a replication exercise and a referee report.",

While a growing body of evidence has documented many deviations from the simple rational benchmark, it has not yet resulted in a widely accepted alternative modeling paradigm.

Meanwhile, narratives about past environmental conditions and past interactions between humans and their environments provide channels for us to reimagine parts of nature that have been erased from our collective memory, and the forgotten traditional practices in which we interact with nature. We will interrogate the effects of archaeological and historical narratives, based on scientific research, materiality, oral histories, legends, and art recounting past environments on our collective memory and imagination of nature in the midst of species loss and environmental degradation. How do the production, presentation, availability and transmission of these different narratives",

All throughout the course, we will also learn about the fight of Indigenous peoples to reclaim sovereignty over their own bodies.

Indeed, many of the questions currently debated in this field are by no means new, and literature has long been a central medium for grappling with the challenges posed by the vegetal. The dual mission of this seminar will be to: 1) critically assess major texts in the emerging field of plant studies and 2) trace the evolution of literary representations of vegetal life in French and Francophone literatures from the 16th century to the present. We will examine permutations of the vegetal as a philosophical and political construct in tension with conceptions of human and nonhuman animals through such topics as the subjectivity of plants, the sexuality of plants, cross-species alliances, “becoming plant.”",

Everywhere, the barriers to women’s economic engagement reach beyond work and salary to encompass property ownership, capital, credit, and markets. When considered as a whole, these barriers constitute economic exclusion, not just economic inequality. To date, policy, scholarship, and activism on the economic status of women have tended to focus on inequality in the formal workplace, but the full pattern is much more visible when women-owned businesses are examined.",

This course takes an interdisciplinary approach to GBV prevention, grounded in public health but drawing on scholarship from gender and sexuality studies and related fields (social work, legal studies, and others). It does this as a means of both broadening and critiquing the way public health frames GBV. This CBLR-designated course requires students to participate in a team project grounded in community: teams will conduct community-based qualitative research and give a presentation on gender-based violence in the college population that will fill a knowledge gap at a community agency.",

Theoretical concepts representing the singular modes of dispossession that ensnare black femininity, as well as black femininity's re/production of the modern world—concepts such as black flesh, ungendering, fungibility, black mater, plasticity—will be applied to analysis of artworks and the artworks will in turn flesh out these concepts.

By studying canonical theoretical texts alongside disciplinary studies characterized by a feminist and/or queer focus, we will investigate how gender and sexuality are constructed in various contexts, what kind of work they do, and how standards of evidence are marshaled in particular disciplines.

In German-language literature, political models of society, psychological theories on the dynamics of thinking and feeling, and critical discussions of history are often negotiated on the basis of an outline of what childhood is. This is because studying how humans develop promises to provide insight into what it means to be human and permits one to construct images of how humans should live. This line of thought breaks from a centuries-old convention of equating children with animals due to their lack of articulate speech and regretting this phase. In this course, we will read key texts of German-language literature from the Enlightenment to the present day that expound childhood as a special, formative epoch of individual life that, at the same time, grants insight into social dynamics.",

        "description": "In 1803 the German jurist and historian Carl Friedrich von Savigny publishes a civil treatise Das Recht des Besitzes, dealing with the question of how to describe and justify private property as possession. Almost 50 years later, Jacob Grimm delivers a lecture under a similar yet slightly––and decisively––different title: Das Wort des Besitzes, dealing not only with the history and semantics of the word Besitz but with the word itself. His lecture transforms a juridical question into a linguistic one: how is it possible (and is it possible at all) to possess a word? In other words: to turn a language into one’s own in order to possess it? The seminar will discuss aspects of this question in legal, philosophical, political, linguistic, and literary texts by (among others) Rousseau, Kant, Babeuf, Proudhon, Hölderlin, Kleist, Hebel, Marx, and Kafka.–– Senior Seminar.",

The more one thinks about the moment, the more inscrutable it appears. Seemingly the most basic of experiences, the moment remains nevertheless shrouded in darkness, as already Plato, in the late dialogue Parmenides, worried. Our seminar will examine the “darkness of the lived moment,” as Ernst Bloch, the great political philosopher of hope, named it. What appears in the immediacy of our experience, is actually far removed from our understanding, but it does open onto an unforeclosed futurity. We will contemplate this darkness of the lived moment in a constellation of works drawn from literature and the arts; and in relation to theoretical texts by such thinkers as Bloch, Hegel, Nietzsche, Freud, Heidegger, and Blanchot.",

However, at least with the end of the Cold War, national German memory culture has also been challenged by non-national perspectives, especially by the necessity to commemorate the entanglement of National Socialism with Communist totalitarianisms and to situate German memory culture within a Central and Eastern European context. To engage with this tension, we will read theoretical texts that continue to inform current memory debates (Arendt, Mitscherlich), recent social sciences approaches to transgenerational transmissions of psycho-social sequelae of perpetration and complicity (Welzer & al., Mihai, Gobodo-Madikizela), and literary texts that have brought transgenerational transmissions into the focus of public attention (Bernhard, Sebald), in order then to focus on contemporary German-language texts that negotiate the difficulties of commemorating totalitarianisms.",

We consider small shrines and large sanctuaries dedicated to the cult of water deities, such as the Celtic goddess Sequana and Roman Nymphs, to investigate the visual and material cultures associated with these sacred spaces.

How, we will ask, did popular culture reflect and shape struggles over national belonging? How did foreign cultural products come to bear on international relations and transnational flows? In what contexts has culture served as a vehicle of resistance to dominant ideologies and systems of power? Far from a mere \"diversion,\" popular culture instead offers a compelling lens onto the relationship between state and society in Latin America and beyond.",

In this course, we will examine how ideas about gender were a central battleground for the political transformation of the region. We will consider how states and institutions employed conservative gender ideologies as avenues of political and individual control, while shifting ideas about gender also served as avenues for the activation of new political subjects.

Who decided it? What were the effects of this process? How did changes in the pastoral methods and devotional culture during the Spanish domination reflect opposing visions of colonial society? The course explores how these imported religious expressions and their local variations served the different social groups that formed New Spain’s colonial society to negotiate their place in a fluctuating social order and legitimize their struggle for political, economic, and symbolic power. Although mainly focused on Indigenous agency and native conceptions of Christian religion, the course also addresses the agency of Afro-descendants, the emergence of afro-catholic identities, and the intersection between religious identities, race, and gender in daily life and public imagination.P",

Focusing on workers’ perspectives on automation, as well as their attempts to resist it, this course will highlight the unequal experience of automation across geographic, gendered and racialized hierarchies. Considering both micro-level changes in workplaces and global dynamics, we’ll ask: How did textile workers in Bursa and colonial Bombay, tobacco workers in Lebanon, and autoworkers in the United States articulate and act on fears that their labor would become obsolete? And how might colonialism, migration, the offshoring of jobs and the informalization of labor in the Global South be tied to the automation of labor in the Global North?",

While taking a global, comparative perspective, we also attend to local processes, analyzing how landscapes, objects, and people were bound up with imperial trajectories in such contexts as the ancient Mediterranean, Persia, China, the Andes, the Early Modern Atlantic, and the contemporary world. We afford particular attention to local peoples’ relationships with empires, environmental history, political economy, historiography, and imperial art and material culture.",

In this collaborative theory/praxis course we ask with others (Walter Rodney, Eduardo Galeano, or Guamán Poma) how these can be reclaimed through the exercise of the gestures and techniques of below-the-ground materials. What would it mean practically to overturn the histories of plunder, theft, and evacuation and imagine beyond them? A central aspect of the course is to make and visit jewelry as immanent to social and spiritual fabrics.

U.S. public policies based on these theories were deployed both domestically and abroad. The seminar will argue that these two sets of policies—at home and abroad--often draw from similar ideas about hierarchies and categories of human beings; land-use, relations among humans, other living beings, and inanimate earth features; work and livelihoods; gender, race, capacity for self-definition and political self-representation, who should wield power, and so on.",

What does the pattern of gender inequality in social life (how bodies are classified and made unequal, what kinds of bodies command political power, what kinds of work people do and how well they are compensated for their labors, the punishments they receive when they violate the law, etc.) have to do with the way states govern?

In this course, we will survey that relationship, examining some key issues and events which shaped it. The Jews' attitudes and actions will be examined alongside those of their Christian neighbors. Topics covered include: medieval revulsion and attraction; early modern re-evaluations of Judaism and Christianity; modern Christian anti-Semitism, Jewish diplomacy, and the Holocaust; the effects of Vatican II; Israel and the contemporary Christian world.",

This course surveys the linguistic variations in African Englishes and their divergence from other global English varieties, including African American English (AAE). We will explore different forms and pronunciations and examine the historical, political and social contexts of these varieties, including speakers’ attitudes, identity construction, and connections to other global English identities. Additionally, we will discuss how multilingualism influences English use in Africa and how English use affects language choice and policy in sectors such as education and governance across the continent. Overall, we will gain a comprehensive understanding of the linguistic diversity of African Englishes and their impact on language, identity, and policy across the continent.",

The course begins by examining the Palestinian struggle from a historical and geographically contextual lens. It then engages the question of Palestine from an ethnic studies approach centering theories and ideas on indigenous sovereignty, transnational social movements, racial carcerality, sexual and gender politics, displacement and refugeehood, apartheid and international law. We will also examine Palestinian relationships with communities and causes of the global South in the past and present. Students with backgrounds training in Middle East studies, ethnic studies, and/or gender/sexuality studies are especially encouraged to enroll in this course. Students interested in intersectional and interdisciplinary to Middle East and ethnic studies are also encouraged to enroll. There are no prerequisites for this course.",

Developing countries may suffer worse consequences than wealthier countries. At the same time wealthier countries are responsible for most of the greenhouse gas emissions. Maybe we can mitigate or adapt to climate change, but the question whether we should do something about climate change is an ethical question. The ethical question is complex. Who is morally responsible for climate change? Individuals? States and nations? Can past generations be held responsible for their greenhouse gas emissions? Do we have moral obligations toward future generations? Should all countries bear the burden of climate change equally?",

Our questions include: what method is advocated in the Philebus and how does it relate to similar methods in the Phaedrus, Sophist, and Statesman?

And yet, its precise character is a matter of recently growing controversy. Drawing of a mix of historical and contemporary sources, the seminar engages in a close examination of this elusive emotion, paying special attention to ongoing controversies: e.g., Is resentment an essentially moral emotion? Is resentment a form of anger or hatred, or is it significantly different from them?

It will draw examples that illustrate the production of and demand for health, healthcare, and health insurance. The goals of the course are twofold. First, it will provide the basic intuition of the fundamental economic models such as health production, demand for healthcare and demand for insurance. Second, it will introduce key empirical findings in the public health economics literature. Emphasis will be placed on key theoretical insights as well as practical and public health policy implications.",

At the center of our exploration stands Reinhold Niebuhr, a towering figure whose profound insights into the complexities of human nature, power, and justice continue to resonate today. Through a sustained reading of Niebuhr, we will uncover the challenges, contradictions, and possibilities that liberal democracy faced during this transformative period in the United States.

        "description": "For centuries, scholars have looked to religious institutions, theological doctrines, and sacred texts to explain religion’s form and function in culture and society. And while this approach has enabled scholars to neatly prescribe what counts as religious, it’s also caused them to ignore the ways people’s daily faith practices make a mess of this work. Drawing on sub-fields in religious studies, anthropology, and sociology, this course explores how formal ideas of religion expand when confronted with the normality of everyday life. From cooking and talking to prayer and devotion, the “religious” and “non-religious” things people do tell us a lot about how religion animates and is animated by lived experience, and how porous the boundary is between the “sacred” and “profane”.",

This course explores the topic of Jewish–Muslim relations from such angles as religion, literature, philosophy, politics, economics, and social life. Some of the contexts and themes we will examine are the following: attitudes toward Jews and Judaism in earliest Islam; the Judeo-Arabic “symbiosis” of the Middle Ages; social developments in the Jewish–Muslim relationship in the Near East and Europe in the early modern period; Jews and Muslims as ethnic and religious minorities in Western countries today; and Islamic life in the State of Israel.",

We will discuss how such figures employed conceptions of state, nationalism, secularism, democracy, law, gender, and minority rights to articulate multiple futures for national and global Muslim communities and influenced a variety of popular struggles as well as armed movements.

This course takes up questions like these, anchoring its inquiry in interdisciplinary feminist theories of gender and sexuality. Linking theoretical texts to range of grounded contexts—from Court rulings on religious freedom, to fights over sex education in schools, to militarized sexual violence, to capitalism’s regimes of gendered labor—students will develop critical vocabularies for analyzing intimacies between religion, sex, and politics in American empire.",

We will ask questions like the following: How can we trace the growth of the idea that participation in global free markets can facilitate relations of justice? What moral frameworks and theories of human life underwrite the vision of capital markets as a theater for political-ethical action?

In America, in particular, the very notion of what it means to be American has always rested on racial and religious imaginaries that underpin the discourses, myths, and symbols on which this identity relies and gets articulated. Americanness is as much a descriptor of racial and religious positionality as it is of national identity. This seminar interrogates how race and religion constitute each other in the US context.

How did ritual, magic, belief, and myth come to characterize religions of South Asia? How did “caste” and “idol worship” come to dominate the anthropology of Indian religions? What decolonial approaches are now necessary to challenge European categories and theories of experience which have been presumed to work globally?
