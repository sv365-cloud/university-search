With a particular focus on social movements, we will examine the circumstances under which people politically mobilize understandings of gender and sexuality, and how these mobilizations relate to issues like marginalization, migration, colonialism, and capitalism.

Rather than seeing the State as a fixed, absolute entity that exists on a separate plane of existence, this course analyzes the state as an effect-producing abstraction that arises in contested circulations of meaningful signs. Viewing the state as a material abstraction (a complex sign) rather than as an absolute entity, we turn to theories of differentiation in circulation and movement. We attempt to answer the questions: What is movement? What moves? And what does movement create, break down, and change? Thinking about the implications of such questions, we will consider the extent to which differentiations in movement carve out units of governance, how the differences produced in those units might generate change, and how forms of difference might partially escape and alter such movement (or not).",

Students in this course will engage with dimensions of selfhood that we often take for granted by studying senses of self from multidisciplinary and cross-cultural perspectives.",

Over the course of the semester, the computational problems addressed grow in complexity, from simple (e.g. long addition) to moderate (e.g. implementation of one programming language in another) to sophisticated (e.g. an implementation of an AI game player for two-person games of complete information). We study clear and precise formulation of computational problems, use of recursion, and rudimentary analysis of algorithms. The emphasis is on problem solving and insight and crafting beautiful things rather than on coding.",

Security concerns the protection against machines that exploit opportunities and behave maliciously to inflict harm. CSCI1640 will study these two fast-growing, practice-relevant and life-impactful CS fields, conjointly, as they relate, influence or apply to each other. With new concepts introduced from the ground up and using both a holistic and an analytical exposition of ideas, CSCI1640 will address the question of “How do AI and Security intersect, interleave or interfere?” and will cover a variety of topics around the impact that AI has to Security and the role that Security has in AI. Topics include trustworthy and privacy-preserving Machine Learning (ML), secure federated learning, crypto-enhanced neural networks, adversarial ML, ML-based security and cyberattacks, rational cryptography, generative AI, AI safety and superintelligence.",

These changes, in combination with the increasingly wide use of printing in this period, created new kinds of sources for historians to study. This course introduces students to a variety of Song textual genres and how they can be used as sources for historical research.

Libraries of priests and scholars contained recipe books, botanical treatises, magical incantations, rituals, and hymns, while home remedies included recipes against fevers, wounds, and headaches, as well as an awareness of which talismans protected infants and how to thwart being taken by demons that dance in the dark.

In addition to studying this range of films (and film genres), we will read around in film theory, film criticism (including reviews), and gender and sexuality studies.

What happens when its power to organize identity intersects with racism, sectarian ideology, and colonialism? The modern world is often characterized as disjointed, and even secular philosophers and literary critics often agree in their tendency to contrast this chaos with a time in which religion made things feel more stable. We will interrogate this assumption about the stabilizing powers of religion in the cultural context of nineteenth through twenty-first century Britain and its empire. We will think through how this idea of religion appears in its interrelated domestic and colonial contexts, and how it continues to impact the public sphere across the world today.

Historically, it was the year of the Space Shuttle Discovery’s maiden voyage; ongoing famine in Ethiopia; the continuing Cold War; the Macintosh computer; and the shooting of four African-American teenagers on the New York subway. Culturally, 1984 brought us Ghostbusters and The Terminator; Louise Erdrich’s Love Medicine and Milan Kundera’s The Unbearable Lightness of Being; Prince's Purple Rain; the creation of Tetris; and the rise of the infomercial. By focusing on a single year, we consider how culture and politics intertwine in an unfolding history, and how myths animate lived experience.

Moving beyond highly controlled scenarios presents many challenges. Most importantly, mobile robots will interact in complex environments with other robots and people. How can we ensure robots safely do what we want them to do? What are the ethical ramifications of multirobot systems?

In this course, we draw out matters of land, asking how and for whom land matters. Building on scholarship, journalism, public commentary, movements, podcasts, and videos, we explore land as a multifaceted and fundamental source of life, knowledge, community, wealth, power, theft, exclusion, sovereignty, justice, and healing. The course is grounded in US-based land histories and how colonial violence, patriarchy, white supremacy, and capitalism intersect to shape land access, control, and ownership. From this foundation, we explore on-the-ground efforts toward land justice, including decolonization, reparations, agrarian commons, and land trusts. Students will leave the course with frameworks for envisioning and helping to build equitable, just, and healthy Land futures based in stewardship, intention, and care.",

This course engages with current debates in the Critical Humanities and thus makes most of the major figures of continental philosophy accessible, from Hegel to Deleuze.

This seminar explores how the Sapphic functions not just as an identity category but a methodology (a way of reading, writing, looking, listening) and an aesthetic in art, design, fashion, and food. What are the ways in which the Sapphic works with/against lesbian and queer political identities? How does contemporary use of the Sapphic diverge from its past iterations in literature, literary criticism, and visual culture? How might we understand temporality in Sapphic expression (slow-burn, yearning)?

To address these questions, we will read and view texts in a range of media with emphasis on Asian American and African American literary and cultural production from the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.

The course will refract from a simple question: what is a museum? Often a museum contains four qualities: a space defined by architecture, a valuable collection, a mechanism for display, and a reserve or storehouse for objects. From this framework, we will consider value, permanence, scale, curation, memory, archives, form, and intimacy, among other topics. Over the term, we will imagine what museums are and can be through a series of projects, including writing essays, making shoe-box museums, and developing a two-week syllabus on the museum. Our final project will culminate in an exhibition on the possibilities of museums, scheduled for the Cohen Gallery in Fall 2026.",

Although “disability” is often (erroneously) exclusively attributed to later literary and historical moments, the “non-normative” body was frequently centered in premodern negotiations of selfhood, embodiment, agency, and individual and collective identity. In addition to exploring and developing a critical vocabulary for discussions of medieval and early modern disability, and considering fully the charge of anachronism, students will be asked to engage with Medieval and Early Modern texts (and select Classical intertexts) that prioritize disease, diagnosis, impairment, medicine, and corporeal variance, etc., to better understand the determinative role that disability plays in the premodern Weltanschauung.",

Among the topics we will explore are the ways contemporary carceral regimes have been shaped by the afterlives of slavery; the shifting meanings of rehabilitation; the experiences of incarcerated individuals; the Cold War politics and transnational roots of militarized policing in the United States; and the ways gender, sexuality, and age shape imprisonment across the hemisphere.",

Students are required to complete both semesters (HMAN 1000A in the fall and HMAN 1000B in the spring) to receive credit. Admission to the course requires that students have received the Cogut Institute Undergraduate Fellowship for the year in which they enroll. More information about the fellowship and application process may be found at https://humanities.brown.edu/apply/undergraduate-fellowship.",

To what extent is decolonization possible within existing institutional frameworks and digital technologies? This course will approach humanities “data” broadly as quantitative as well as archival, textual, and cultural, and explore innovative approaches to decolonizing data in Caribbean digital humanities projects and critical DH. Through hands-on workshops, theoretical readings, and evaluation of projects such as the Early Caribbean Digital Archive and Algorithmic Justice League, the course will interrogate questions of data ethics in the colonial archive, data justice, digital practices of care, and community-centered archiving. Students will find or create a dataset and develop a data management, preservation, and sharing plan that puts into practice decolonizing methodologies.

In this course, we will examine how American politics is shaped by struggles between social groups over the meanings and status of group identities. First, we will examine theoretical perspectives suggesting political behavior can be seen as symbolic action to affirm—and sometimes legally enforce—one’s own morality, social status, lifestyle practices, and vision of the proper social world. Then, we will apply this framework to understanding two areas of American politics: the politics of white racial resentment, and stalled political action to address climate change. This course will provide conceptual tools for understanding what’s at stake in public debates for many Americans, and how elite-public interactions over the meanings and status of group identities have shaped American politics in the 20th and 21st centuries.",

The growth of social media and the ubiquity of digital devices that can record, photograph, and upload events from a first-person perspective has made all participants in historical events into potential archivists. Through an examination of digital documentation created by ordinary citizens during major events in recent history—including the COVID-19 pandemic, racial justice protests, and the January 6 insurrection—we ask, what kinds of archives are we and our digital devices creating? What kinds of histories can or should be written with these records?

Together, we will explore the central tenets of CRT, including the ubiquity and permanence of racism, intersectionality, whiteness as property and currency, and redistributive justice. Reading seminal texts of CRT alongside contemporary African American literature, we will attend to specific topics, such as affirmative action, immigration, mass incarceration, and reparations. The overarching inquiry of this course is: (1) how might the law be complicit in upholding racial hierarchy as well hierarchies of gender, class, sexuality, and citizenship, and (2) how might the law and literature be used to dismantle those same hierarchies?",

Those traces have always been in flux, subject to changing cultural, environmental, and technological factors. While stone carvings, bones, ruins, and other durable objects have long encouraged reflections about the beings who created them, there are also those who have considered smells, flowers, dreams, and other seemingly ephemeral phenomena to be traces of distant pasts. What can be a trace of the past? How have people followed these traces? And how might the insights and oversights of these past ways of knowing the past inform our own efforts to identify or create traces for an uncertain future?

Yet the “grounds” of comparison are largely Euro-colonial turf, even when all the comparanda involved arrive from far outside the bounds of Western modernity. Led by readers of literature outside the circle of the modern West, this seminar asks: Can we compare from elsewhere? How can we attain comparative vantage points on culturally and temporally unalike texts without occupying the spaces of epistemic and political domination? Together we will interrogate grounds of comparison through explorations of transregional and transhistorical readings, including Third-Worldist manifestos, medieval Arabic philosophy, and multiscriptal poetics from early Japan. We consider the stakes and ethics of comparison and comparatism; strategies for decentering staid paradigms without turning our backs on theory or history; and potential affinities among mutually remote texts and their readers.",

Drawing inspiration from various intellectual traditions, we will look at different scales of damage and repair. We will ask how these concepts have been used and abused in efforts to undo the harms which humans do to other humans, and to the world they inhabit and share. Advocating for reparations for slavery in the United States has often taken German reparations for Nazi crimes as a historical reference and precedent: our seminar will consider analogies and differences, as well as the limits of this model.

While the practice of diplomacy and the policy-making process has a U.S. focus, the lessons learned apply to other nation states as well. We briefly review the history of inter-state relations, including the international legal basis for diplomatic relations. Diplomacy has evolved over the years and has been greatly influenced by modern technology; however, it continues to incorporate such common functions as policy formulation, representation, reporting, negotiation, intercultural contacts and interaction with the media, parliamentary bodies and other external actors.

The first is the \"Linguistic Relativity\" hypothesis: that differences in the way languages encode/express meanings have some effect on cognition. While this is a popular hypothesis it is often phrased without attention to what is meant by 'cognition': what aspects of the cognition of its speakers might be shaped by the particulars of a language's structure or vocabulary? The second prong is to examine the cause and effect in the other direction: How do facts about human cognition in general shape language, and how can commonalities across languages be explained by non-linguistic facts about cognition? Of course these are both very broad questions; we will explore them with respect to specific domains such as pronoun systems, the expression of time, the encodings of differences between substances and objects, etc.",

Following Eva Horn to consider air as “a medium of life,” this graduate seminar explores the implications and possibilities in conception of atmospheric matters and conditions in relation to media history and theory. We propose the notion of “atmospheric media” as the center of our inquiry, approaching it both materially as atmospheric things (e.g., physicochemical compounds, movements, and reactions) and conceptually as atmospheric thinking (e.g., environmentality, immersion, and affect). Drawing from literatures in environmental science, media theory, ecocriticism, and decolonial thought, we hope to rethink air and media through their mutual entanglements.",

A common mistake policy-makers, politicians, executives, or social business founders make is to address the problem they want to tackle as if it were “technical” i.e. only requiring expertise and appropriate tools. However, wicked problems have “adaptive” aspects: their root causes and their impact have to do with people’s beliefs, values, habits, or behaviors. Leaders need to use Emotional Intelligence to leverage their own strengths as well as the conditions that enable success,",

Building on existing scholarly approaches to the role of play in human flourishing, it asks how play structures music, sports, and game in ways that are comparable, how the different modalities of each activity give rise to unique principles of play and competition, and how these three domains interact with one another. Topics will include musical improvisation and competition, in forums ranging from rap battles to air guitar; the role of sound in professional sports marketing and in-game experience design; the songs that enliven children’s games and the soundtracks of video games; forms such as capoeira, which involve playful interaction in several different domains; and many more.",

Third, we turn to the importance of status: why the preoccupation with the recognition of others is a source of profound anxiety.

We will examine and compare prominent models of why people become addicted to substances. Using the socioecological model as a framework, we will analyze key risk and protective factors for substance misuse including (a) individual factors such as biological susceptibility, personality, and co-occurring psychiatric disorders, (b) interpersonal factors such as peer use and social support, (c) community factors such as access to alternative reinforcers and neighborhood resources, and (d) societal factors such as racism, social and economic inequalities, and stigma around addiction. Using this framework, we will analyze how social determinants of health impact substance use and its negative consequences in marginalized populations.",

Although our focus is on the development of methods in the field of epidemiology, what constitutes an “epidemiologic method” has become less clear as the lines dividing fields have blurred.

We will read translations of the Sanskrit Ramayana and the Mahabharata and retellings of these stories to explore why India’s epics occupy such an energetic place in the ritual, literary, visual, and political imaginary of India. Why do these great epics continue to speak beyond borders of time and culture? In what ways does the epic culture of India challenge Western ideas about text and authorship? Why have the epics and given rise to wide and divergent interpretations, critiques, and recreations? How do different regions claim and create their regional identity through their own epic traditions? How do devotional traditions or national politics play in the interpretation–and revival—of epics?",

Although, the Russian literary angels are in many respects related to their Western counterparts, the apocalyptic character of Russian spiritual culture makes them in many respects unique. Examining these images, the course addresses the important questions concerning the human condition in general. Angels as one critic said, \"represent something that was ours and that we have the potential to become again\"; their essence is otherness. Consequently, their literary representations explore the possibilities of human existence as well as its central paradigms like, love, rebirth, mortality, or 'fallenness.' The course will analyze the images of angels and fallen angels (devils) in the works of the nineteenth and the twentieth-century Russian prose, visual art, and film - from romanticism to 'postmodernism' - in the context of the world literature and culture. Authors to be studied: Byron, Lermontov, Balzac, Dostoevskii, Sologub, Bulgakov, Nabokov, Erofeev. We will also discuss films by Tarkovskii and Wenders, Russian icons, and paintings by Vrubel.

Given the country’s conflicted self-identification as neither fully European nor Asian, demarcations between the “self” and the “other” were more porous for Russian cultural practitioners than for their Western European counterparts, resulting in representations that were prone to hybridity, syncretism, and even self-Orientalization. Taking Edward Said’s definition of Orientalism as a point of departure, the course will examine the writings of Pushkin, Lermontov, Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy; the paintings of Briullov, Aivazovskii, Vereshchagin, Polenov, Vrubel, Roerich, and Kuznetsov; and stage productions of The Tale of Tsar Saltan, Prisoner of the Caucasus, Scheherazade, and Les Orientales.

Why is there such a large gap between the \"modern\" ideal of formal equality and the reality of factual inequality? Why do differences of class, race and gender persist?

These questions have motivated generations of sociologists, but many of the arguments continue to be informed by the foundational classical theorists: Karl Marx, Max Weber, Emile Durkheim and W.E.B Du Bois. Looking at the transformations around them – the rise of capitalism, the modern nation-state, rational bureaucracy, the spread of colonialism, the decline of religion, struggles for emancipation and much more – they developed arguments that allow us to better understand ourselves, our actions, and the contemporary political, economic and social transformations around us.

The inquiry will continue beyond studio production and into alternative and public spaces, with an introduction to installation art, social practice, performance art, and dematerialized practices. The focus of the course is on interdisciplinary experimentation of complex ideas through problem solving, laying the groundwork for advanced courses in the arts.",
