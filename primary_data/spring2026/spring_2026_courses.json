        "description": "This course examines the terrain of black popular culture and its enduring yet shifting relationship to forms of social and political resistance employed by African-Americans in the US. This course offers a deep dive into two complex, related questions central to the field of Black Cultural Studies: 1) what is \"black popular culture\" and what can we learn by studying it in a social context? 2) How do black popular cultural forms both reproduce the status quo as well as enable black people to resist the status quo? In this course, we will engage with major texts and key theoretical concepts from Black Cultural Studies to help us analyze black popular cultural works via in-class listening and viewing of popular media to consider both the normative and resistive dimensions of black popular culture in a social context.",

        "description": "Literary historians generally agree that in the 1970s, in the U.S., there was a significant increase in the publication of diverse forms of African American literature. The 1970s is also often described by scholars as a decade in which there was a renaissance of African American women’s writing as well as the publication of several experimental African American literary works. In this seminar, we will study this lively period in African American literary history primarily through novels, some of them recently republished or adapted into other forms. What idea of African American literature do we get when we read novels from this era? What questions were asked in 1970s African American novels that we continue to ask now? Novels we will likely read include detective fiction, diaristic fiction, satirical fiction, a love story, and historical fiction.",

BAM artists used ritual, poetry, music, song, dance, and theatre to identify, disrupt, and examine human thought and action that produced and sustained racism, poverty, colonialism, and sexism. In our class, students will study BAM manifestos, poetry, and plays designed to transform audiences. These course readings will be augmented by regular, on-your-feet, interactive workshops in BAM performance techniques such as improvisational theatre, agit-prop, and the choreopoem. Along the way, we will also dive into the origins of Brown’s own Rites & Reason Theatre (est. 1971), and the importance of community-engaged participant research in the African American theatre tradition.",

It pays particular attention to how ideas around race respond to broader global forces.

Reading narratives from a select group of instances, we will explore, against the broader theoretical work on global revolutions, the more specific meaning of revolution in Africana history and literature.

This seminar introduces students to conversations in trans studies and decolonial environmental humanities through key texts in both fields, with consideration to subaltern theories and methodologies, cultural geography, literary studies, creative practice, and visual & aesthetic culture.

The 21st century has seen a proliferation of LGBTQ+ representation in media through an apparently progressive political moment – from the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell to federal legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States. However, these new media have also come up among increased censorship, book bans, and homo- and transphobic violence, in a reflection of the not-so-linear story of queer representation. By examining memoir, film, television, and internet cultures, we will explore these developments through a framework of queer that goes beyond sexual orientation, and consider the role of the non-normative under racial capitalism, heteropatriarchy, the carceral state, and United States empire across oceans.",

        "description": "Aging is a fundamental biological process. It is the major risk factor for age-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, osteoporosis, arthritis and Alzheimer's, just to name a few. As life expectancy has increased in the 20th century, these diseases have become the leading causes of death. Recent research has identified universal mechanisms that regulate organismal aging and impact all organ systems. Several gene networks that can regulate the rate of aging and multiple age-related diseases have already been discovered. These mechanisms are conserved throughout evolution and many key insights have been garnered from simple model organisms. Manipulation of these networks has been achieved by diet, genetic engineering, and most recently, with drugs. The goal of modern medicine is to increase healthy survival, as opposed to simply longevity. It is now generally acknowledged that increasing health span – the fraction of our life spans free of frailty and debilitating chronic disease – has become a realistic goal. This course will examine the new concept of \"geroscience\" – the molecular, cellular, and genetic foundations of the biology of aging, and how this knowledge can be applied to therapies for age-associated diseases. Course material will be based on the primary research literature. Prerequisites are a background in cell biology, molecular biology and genetics - such as BIOL0470, BIOL0280, BIOL0200, and BIOL0800.",

We will take stock of the complex “big picture”—for example, how national aesthetic conventions color Latinx attitudes towards self-expression. We will also proceed on more intimate, interpersonal terms, turning our attention to the everyday practices and imaginaries by which Latinx subjects negotiate their subjectivities within an American national project that demands assimilation without civic inclusion. The course will draw on an array of materials, bringing academic scholarship and pop culture commentaries to bear on music albums, lyrics, short stories, novels, and more.",

We will study cultural-historical contexts that gave rise to the internationally acclaimed Czech animation by Trnka, Svankmajer and others. Fascination with Czech animation in Japan used as an example to illustrate the mechanism of cross-cultural reception of Czech animation.

We will trace how the Uncanny and the hauntings from a colonial past inform the present as the afterlives of colonialism, and how colonial thought continues to design modern realities and politics.

Peripatetic writers, the subject of Rebecca Solnit’s Wanderlust, detach themselves from the speed and distractedness of the everyday and return to writing at a mediative pace. Students will write every day and their writing will be based on what they observe while walking—anywhere: to class, to coffee shops, through libraries and museums. Readings will be gathered from writers on walking, among other things. The objectives: to learn how to discover the extraordinary in the ordinary; to learn how to accumulate notes and reflections and to integrate them gradually into longer narratives.",

        "description": "This graduate seminar pursues an interdisciplinary investigation of various philosophies, theories, and expressive praxes that constellate under the rubric of The Black Aesthetic. Our study is organized along two axes: The first reckons with colonial modernity’s role in constructing the aesthetic as a racializing technology to measure and impose taste, sensibility, reason and/as civilizational capacity. The second grapples with the political orientations that, nonetheless, undergird contemporary black cultural production across literary genres and visual/media forms. Engaging such thinkers as Édouard Glissant, Saidiya Hartman, Denise Ferreira da Silva, Phillip Brian Harper, Sylvia Wynter, and Kevin Quashie, among others, we will study such black aesthetic theories as opacity, fabulation, excess, dissimulation, (anti-)representation, and black world(ing).",

We attend to the long history of this multivalent and multicombinant racism in two ways, by 1) studying pre-modern forms of collective hatred and fear that emerged prior to the putative stabilization of race as an identitarian category, and 2) exploring how to conceptualize relationally the various racial formations that emerged in modernity out of the slave trade, colonialism, and Nazism. Theorists we study include: daSilva, Foucault, Heng, Mbembé, Said, Spillers, Wolfe, and Wynters. The literary works we read include: The King of Tars, The Canterbury Tales, The Tempest, Jane Eyre, Ceremony, Jasmine, and Beloved.",

The class begins with an overview of the global financial system, including instruments like stocks, bonds, currencies, mutual funds, banks, pension funds, and insurance companies. This financial architecture will then be used to examine what impact investing is and how it can be used to address social and environmental issues. To encourage discussion and participation, to ensure that students are eager to learn about the issues, and to try to accommodate a wealth of ideas, backgrounds and perspectives, the class will be by application only.",

Modern agriculture has become incredibly productive, fueling the global grain trade, the meatification of human diets, and the exponential expansion of food and non-food products. Still, the number of people who are hungry, food insecure, and/or malnourished is stable or increasing in various parts of the world. As global population rises, calls to further increase and intensify agricultural production ring out across the globe. Through (agro-)ecological, feminist, and justice lenses, we will explore the political economy of food insecurity and agriculture, the political ecology of agricultural development, and critical humanist approaches to the past, present, and future of farming. We will connect with human geographers, sociologists, anthropologists, historians, Indigenous scholars, Black Studies scholars, feminists, and people working outside of academia.",

While studying these politics of access and authority worldwide and historically, we create our own community of knowledge and practice by going birding with adults or schoolchildren.

Ultimately, our ability to predict how species, communities and ecosystems will respond to climate change and to develop strategies for conservation are dependent upon insights from the field of biogeography.

Readings will be organized topically and cover interdisciplinary ethnographic and theory-based scholarship on non-normative gender and sexuality in Asia, broadly conceived. We’ll approach the terms “queer,” “trans,” and “Asia” as heterogenous, mobile, and changing concepts. We’ll examine how they are constructed and contested, as well as how they intersect with dynamics of race, kinship, activism, migration, class, religion, and neoliberalism (among others). The course aims to complicate Euro-American epistemologies in disciplines like queer studies, anthropology, and the social sciences more generally.",

        "description": "Gender and Sexuality Studies is by its very nature interdisciplinary. Can we speak of any single methodology that ties GNSS together? How might scholars working on gender/sexuality acknowledge disciplinary boundaries and use disciplinary training effectively? We will start with the premise that studies in gender and sexuality are tied together by questioning foundational assumptions within a given field of knowledge and taking account of our own subject positions vis-à-vis our objects of study. By studying canonical theoretical texts alongside disciplinary studies characterized by a feminist and/or queer focus, we will investigate how gender and sexuality are constructed in various contexts, what kind of work they do, and how standards of evidence are marshaled in particular disciplines. Particular attention will be given to the role of critique, affect, and materialisms, including the materiality of language, in gender and sexuality studies.",

How do monuments shape political imaginations and civic practices? Whose stories have we told and to what effects? How have citizens experienced, ignored, or contested public commemoration at local and national levels, in universities and other locations? What should we do about oppressive monuments and disparities in public commemoration? Drawing on a variety of fields and disciplines, from political theory, philosophy, history, art and art history, visual culture, anthropology, etc., as well as the work of artists, philanthropic institutions, activists, and local and national governments, we will explore histories of commemoration and contestation, keeping in mind that public monuments are palimpsest of memory that seek to tell some stories and drown out others.",

        "description": "This course examines fine art in the US from roughly 1900 through the 1970s, with special attention to modernism and the rise of modern art. Through slide presentations and group discussion, most major figures of the period—Georgia O'Keeffe, Edward Hopper, Alexander Calder, Jackson Pollock, and Andy Warhol among them—will be placed in historical and cultural context. Key events, institutions, and critics of these decades will also be considered. We will look at the role of cultural episodes like the Harlem Renaissance, and the increasing prevalence of women in the art world, as markers of increasing diversity and changing values. Readings by leading scholars will allow a wide-ranging introduction to art historical methods of interpretation. Discussion in sections will help place this art within the context of social history, the invention of national identity, and parallel developments in popular visual culture.",

New class and gender dynamics changed patterns of sociability. Technological innovations mass produced images and goods. In this course, we will discern such social and historical factors in Europe and across the globe alongside artistic ones to interrogate what makes art in this period irrepressibly modern. We will study the turbulence that has defined the century, including the art historical swings in style from Classicism to Romanticism to Impressionism, with care.

Alongside texts on critique in philosophy and theory, we will examine artists for whom criticality is paramount: Dada’s ballistic mission, repetitions of the neo-avant-garde, anti-art, institutional critique, critical postmodernism, art as undercommons.

Within the period of the Company’s relentless pursuit of profits, artists trained in India, China, and Britain forged relationships across cultures and experimented with materials and techniques to produce striking artworks. This course interrogates the relationship between these artists and a corporation. It asks whether “style” links such disparate arts through subjects of colonial interest—including portraits and ethnographic types, landscapes and architectural drawings, plants and animals—or if the description holds only through the terminology of “Company” art that developed as the British empire waned. Students will engage with these arts in Brown’s collections, and in the exhibition, Painters, Ports & Profits: Artists and the East India Company, 1760-1830, at the Yale Center for British Art.",

In our readings, we will see how at times the two are indistinguishable (a slippage that is evident in the Portuguese “exploraçao” meaning “exploitation”); at others, we will glimpse at the authors’ desire to replenish landscapes, restitute rights and reimagine worldviews beyond the regimes brought forth by the adjective “Colonial”.

Tourism is a fascinating point of departure through which we can examine how histories of empire, consumerism, gender, and the environment all converge upon practices many (but certainly not all) of us take for granted. The premise of this seminar is based on two basic questions: through tourism, how do we change a place and how does that place change us? How does human mobility produce a new set of economic, social, and political relations? The answers will vary across time and space, but through engagement with scholarship and various primary sources we can come to better understand how the pleasure modern-day travelers derive from temporarily being someplace else is ultimately something deeply embedded into the structures and historical processes of the modern world itself.",

Proceeding chronologically, we begin with the global context of Columbus’s fateful voyage in 1492, before turning to colonial Spanish, Portuguese, and English-British intersections with the Ottoman Empire and Morocco. While including Latin American, Caribbean, and Canadian case studies, the bulk of our course explores US ties to the “Mideast/MENA” region during the 19 th -21 st centuries. Yet, this isn’t a conventional course in diplomatic history. Rather, we’ll read closely for underlying socioeconomic, cultural, and intellectual processes—trade, migration, education, and evolving conceptions of race, religion, and citizenship—themes often overlooked by foreign relations, watershed events, or conflict. Our goal: to recognize how US-Middle East ties are far more complex, rich, and deep-rooted than is generally assumed.",

For Zionism, originating in late nineteenth-century antisemitism and East-Central European ethno-territorial nationalism, the “final solution” proved the need for a Jewish-majority state in Palestine. Yet the majority of the population in Eretz Israel was Palestinian. The creation of Israel in 1948 was the outcome of a bitter war with the local Arab population and the surrounding states, in the course of which most of the Palestinians were expelled or fled, facilitating the establishment of a Jewish-majority state. The seminar will discuss the fraught question of the two traumatic events of the Holocaust and the Nakba (the expulsion of 1948), and propose that we can both better understand these events, and begin the long path to reconciliation, by applying the tools of empathetic first-person history.",

        "description": "How have Black queer communities — and minoritarian communities more broadly — transformed environments of shame and disposability into sources of erotic power, pleasure, and collective survival? Building on Toni Morrison’s “Sula” and theories from Black feminisms, queer-of-color critique, and Black ecological thought, this course views the “bottom” as Black queer ecological thought. We will trace how Black queer communities generate counter-knowledge, reshape racialized and sexual subjectivities, and challenge conventional environmental discourse by queering ecological analysis. Ultimately, this course examines the “bottom” as both a sexual position and an ecological site historically raced, and marked as disposable, dirty, abject. Readings from Morrison, Jennifer Nash, Audre Lorde, Darieck Scott, Juana María Rodríguez, Kathryn Bond Stockton, and Leo Bersani will guide our exploration of how landscapes of racial abjection and erotic desire converge, offering new critical tools for environmental humanities.",

When does a change in scale mean a change in kind? Is morality/ethics a question of scale? Should we think big, or is the devil in the details?

The seminar, oriented toward revising the book, reexamines the reasoning that supports these intuitions and their implications: a transformation of moral discourse; a new ontology of “moral things”; the primacy of others over the self; a downgrade of “liberty,” “justice,” and “rights”; and a critical interest in the historical conditions of political action.

Then, we will turn our attention to how individual speakers use language to construct identities, portray stances, and achieve interactional goals. Throughout the course, we will consider how ideologies about linguistic variation have been used to invalidate particular ways of speaking and disempower speakers of these varieties, and how language can reflect, reinforce, or contest social inequalities.",

In other words, when we rely on only a reader's perspective to guide us as artists, it provides little to no sense of artistic path. This workshop is for writers of all levels to explore several works-in-progress in more depth. The result will be an enhanced relationship to the works (and to process) and to a lifelong and sustainable creativity.

How might poets’ negotiations of mastery speak to the intersection of their aesthetic, linguistic, cultural, historical, and political concerns? How do poets materialize a rejection or reconfiguration of mastery within decolonial practices attentive to craft and concept? The texts we will primarily engage are African, Arab(ic), and Native American, by authors at home(s) and in diaspora. Class time will blend workshop, discussion, and writing.

As the notion of nation-state has increasingly been problematized, the concept of “national cinema,” which frames cinematic works according to their countries of origin, has come into question. This course revisits this theoretical debate by exploring the transnational connections among different film cultures in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea. The course will emphasize as much the local diversities and specificities as the stylistic, generic, thematic, and industrial conjunctions across national/cultural boundaries. While surveying major genres and auteurs in East Asian cinemas, such as Wong Kar-Wai, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Ozu, Kurosawa, Park Chan-wook and Bong Joon-ho, through the theoretical frameworks of nationalism, transnationalism, post-colonialism, and globalism, the course will particularly focus on the shifting representation of identities of gender,",

We understand “ecology” not just as a thematic concern of media content or as a scientific and cultural narrative on media platforms. Instead, we approach it as a critical framework to rethink perception, relationality, embodiment, and systems of meaning. We analyze the material conditions—geophysical resources, labor, and infrastructures—that enable media technologies and explore “media” as a dynamic process of “mediation” and networks of technologies of power. In an era of climate crises, we ask how ecological and media systems coconstitute subjectivity, community, and political agency.

We will examine animation’s historical development and stylistic possibilities, from the earliest stop-motion animations to the latest computer graphic techniques, exploring the aesthetics of animation as a fertile ground to interrogate the relationship between changing technological conditions and often-racialized bodily experience in modern society marked by mobility, fragmentation, and demarcation. It is also meant to give you a different way to think about the basic concepts in film history and theory, moving away from the assumption of an essentially photographic medium to consider different ways in which moving images are produced, received, and appreciated.",

This seminar explores the music, fashion, film, literature and visual art of punk as a complex intersection of subculture, style and self-making; noise and disobedience; and collaboration and creativity in the face of annihilation. Since punk’s arrival in the US and the UK in the 1970s, its subcultures and cultural productions have been associated with practices of dissent and refusal in the face of authoritarian political and cultural forces. Over the course of the semester, we attend to the unruly sounds, textures and manifestos of punk, with a particular emphasis on Black and Brown punk provocateurs, race, class and gender relations, collaboration, DIY practices, and creativity “underground.”",

While making Gaza the perspective from which this international order, and its image, will be studied, the seminar will focus on three key concepts: Holocaust, Genocide, and Settler Colonialism.

Many of our beliefs are formed on the basis of testimony—by reading or hearing about facts that we have not directly observed. One of the central questions of social epistemology is how we ought to treat testimonial evidence. Should we accept testimony at face value, or should we require further evidence that the testimony comes from a trustworthy source? How can we determine that a source is trustworthy? Questions about testimony naturally lead to questions about epistemic injustice. Do we unfairly inflate or discount the testimony of an individual based on their gender, race, or class? Do current epistemic practices and institutions unfairly advantage or disadvantage particular bodies of knowledge? How can we ameliorate these injustices?",

We’ll discuss the three main proposals, that knowledge is perception, true judgment, and true judgment with an account. We’ll also discuss a fourth possibility introduced at the outset, that knowledge is expertise (technē). Of all Plato’s works, the Theaetetus is the most appealing from a contemporary philosophical perspective, because its final section has been taken to propose a popular 20th century view of knowledge—as justified true belief—and to state difficulties with that proposal. Much else in the dialogue will be discussed: e.g., Socrates’ midwifery, Protagorean relativism, the famous Digression interrupting the critique of relativism; parts and wholes; and the notion of logos (account). Readings will be in English.",

We will discuss controversies about shame, such as: Is shame an essentially social emotion? Is shame essentially heteronomous? Is shame essentially an emotion of self-assessment? Can shame be an appropriate moral emotion?

Co-designed with local harm reduction professionals, it centers lived experience while providing students with historical, political, and practical foundations. Core topics include harm reduction philosophy and principles; drug criminalization, stigma, and racialized policy; and current drug trends. Students will examine U.S. and global harm reduction policies and programs, service models, emerging technologies, and the contributions of the harm reduction workforce. Weekly spotlights address communities disproportionately affected by drug-related harms, including people of color, gender-diverse individuals, and people experiencing housing instability. Through case studies, guest speakers, and community-based learning, students will develop an evidence-informed, community-driven harm reduction intervention tailored to a specific population and setting.",

It explores how Portugal’s national myth of a country open to diversity, shaped by its colonial past, obscures issues of racism and migration. The course traces how migration policies have evolved in a postcolonial context, analyzes media’s role in perpetuating stereotypes, and investigates the rise of far-right anti-immigration mobilization. It also highlights immigrant resistance to these changes. Using Paulo Freire's critical pedagogy, the course encourages collaborative learning and participatory practices, fostering dialogue and decolonizing methodologies in migration studies. Students will engage actively in discussions, readings, and reflections, contributing to an exchange of ideas among students, faculty, and guest lecturers.

Drawing on sub-fields in religious studies, anthropology, and sociology, this course explores how formal ideas of religion expand when confronted with the normality of everyday life. From cooking and talking to prayer and devotion, the “religious” and “non-religious” things people do tell us a lot about how religion animates and is animated by lived experience, and how porous the boundary is between the “sacred” and “profane”.",

In some cases, female practitioners are treated positively, while in others, we find more disparaging depictions.

One of the earliest debates in Islamic history had to do with the question of theodicy: the problem of evil. This was connected to issues of free will and predestination. From the early Middle Ages onward people asked, what kind of all-powerful God holds humans accountable for things out of their power to control? If people are in fact in control of their own actions, what would that say about the nature and power of God? Does evil come from people or God, and if the latter, what does that say about the nature of Divinity?

We will especially study how he tried to embody self-practices that, despite their challenges, ultimately make hope and transformation possible even under dire conditions. We will read Gandhi’s core writings to engage him not as a static icon but as a person who learned through trial and error, faced controversy, and experienced hardship and loneliness.

In recent years, scholars, writers, and artists have been calling for new ways to address “plant blindness”; finally, it appears that plants are having a moment. Plants are crucial to the survival of human life. From the food we eat, to the air we breathe, the clothes we wear, plant bodies are used to build homes, cure our ailments, and feed our addictions. Putting plants to use is tantamount to survival but this course aims for a less extractive relationship with plants. This course explores what we might gain by learning from plants–to know them, think with them, and attune our senses to their liveliness.
